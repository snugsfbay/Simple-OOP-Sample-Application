# Simple-OOP-Sample-Application
Or is it a Sample OOP Simple Application? Either way, package includes some UI and some logic to demonstrate coding concepts for RAD2 learners.

Concepts to look for:
* static vs instance methods
* private vs public methods and properties
* annotated methods
* annotated properties, do you remember why they are different?
* encapsulation -- how does it differ between the code for the Flow UI and the code for the Lightning Component UI?
* wrapper class thrown in for fun, can you find it?
* constructor methods
* super simple test method that does some super simple testing, needs more
* custom exception class for required fields to demo throwing and catching custom messages
* really crappy comments because this was just an exercise to help out some learners
